# American Ambition & Accountability Act (AAA)

**A blueprint for safe, transparent, and accelerated federal innovation.**

---

## Overview

The American Ambition & Accountability Act (AAA) is a federal reform proposal to establish a rigorous, transparent “sandbox” process for testing bold ideas across U.S. government agencies. It enables safe-to-fail pilots, rapid experimentation, live public oversight, and robust safeguards—while ensuring accountability, equity, and public trust.

## What Does AAA Do?

- **Creates a Federal Sandbox Authority:**  
  Any agency can propose pilot programs with streamlined approval and oversight, including time-boxed Level-1 and Level-2 pilots.
- **Enforces Transparency & Auditability:**  
  All charters, KPIs, audit memos, and financial flows are posted live on a public dashboard, backed by hash-chain proofs and audit ledgers.
- **Independent Red-Team Board:**  
  Pilots undergo adversarial review and OPSEC checks by a mixed-appointment oversight board.
- **Public Participation:**  
  Citizen input, open comment periods, and micro-grant vouchers expand access beyond D.C. insiders.
- **Risk Controls:**  
  Built-in stop-loss triggers, supply-chain security, privacy guard-rails, and sunset clauses to prevent runaway risks.
- **Union & Equity Protections:**  
  Guarantees job-security, right-of-refusal, reskilling, and equity audits for all impacted workers.
- **State & Tribal Partnerships:**  
  Model MOU allows states, territories, and tribes to participate or replicate sandbox pilots.
